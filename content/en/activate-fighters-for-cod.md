Starting with the team that has the initiative, teams take turns in activating one fighter per player until all fighters have been activated.

An activated fighter can perform actions (move, attack, disengage, or wait), and they can use an ability before or after every action. Normal fighter can perform two actions, but a waiting fighter or a monster can only perform one.
