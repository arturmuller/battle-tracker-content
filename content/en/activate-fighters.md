Players take turns in activating fighters until all fighters have been activated. The player who has the initiative decides who goes first.

An activated fighter can perform actions (move, attack, disengage, or wait), and they can use an ability before or after every action. Usually fighters can perform two actions, but a waiting fighter or a monster can only perform one.
